Description: Fitting, cross-validating, and predicting with Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) models. It is designed for analyzing educational datasets to trace student knowledge over time. The package includes functions for fitting BKT models, evaluating their performance using various metrics, and making predictions on new data. It provides the same functionality as the Python package pyBKT authored by Bulut et al. (2023, <doi:10.3390/psych5030050>) and pyBKT can be accessed via the site at <https://github.com/CAHLR/pyBKT>.
